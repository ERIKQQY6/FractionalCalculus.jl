# Arbitrary Order Fractional Derivative

While most of the algorithms only support for limit scope, we also provide arbitrary order fractional derivative, thanks to the outstanding work of [Prof Igor Podlubny](http://people.tuke.sk/igor.podlubny/index.html) for ```Triangular Strip Matrices```.

In FractionalCalculus.jl, you can compute arbitrary fractional derivative using the specific algorithm ```RLDiff_Matrix```:

```julia-repl
julia> fracdiff(f, Î±, end_point, h, RLDiff_Matrix())
```

For example, we want to calculate the $3.6$ order fractional deriavtive of $f(x)=x^5$ in interval $[0, 6]$:

```julia-repl
julia> fracdiff(x->x^5, 3.6, 1, 0.001, RLDiff_Matrix())
```

We can also compute the analytical solution:

```math
f(x)=\frac{\Gamma(6)}{\Gamma(2.4)}x^{1.4}
```

Aftrer we plot the numerical and the analytical, we can see FractionalCalculus.jl obtain a high precision:
