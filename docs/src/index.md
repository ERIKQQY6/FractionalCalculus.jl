# FractionalCalculus.jl

Hello there! FractionalCalculus.jl is a Julia package aiming at providing support for computing fractional derivative and fractional integral.

## Installation

To install FractionalCalculus, run the following command in Julia REPL:

```julia
] add FractionalCalculus
```

Or if you want to experience the latest version of FractionalCalculus.jl, you can directly clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ErikQQY/FractionalCalculus.jl
```

## Features

FractionalCalculus now has algorithms for Caputo fractional derivative, Grunwald-Letnikov fractional derivative and Riemann-Liouville fractional integral support, more algorithms are planned to support to enrich the package ecosystem.

## Plans

- Symbolic differentiation and integration
- FractionalCalculus.jl website with online experiencing
- Add more visualization of how the fraction derivative and integral are changing based on Makie or Javis or Manim
- Fractional differential equations
